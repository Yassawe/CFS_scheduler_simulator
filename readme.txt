%INPUT%

Input should be in the form:

process_name nice_value burst_time arriving_time
process_name nice_value burst_time arriving_time
process_name nice_value burst_time arriving_time

You can also simply input the names of the processes, without specifying values, but need to list each new process in a new line. 

%CFS%
Counter is used to keep track of the real time, therefore no units are used. You can change values as quantum, granularity, and timestep in the code.
